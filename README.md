# SPEAR: C++/SPIR-V Shader Runtime

## Overview

SPEAR is a integrated domain specific language translating C++17 to SPIR-V at host runtime.

```cpp
template <bool Assemble = true>
class Mandelbrot : public FragmentProgram<Assemble>
{
public:
	Mandelbrot() : FragmentProgram<Assemble>("Mandelbrot"){};
	~Mandelbrot() {};

	RenderTarget OutputColor;
	inline void operator()()
	{
		f32 i = 0.f, max = 100.f;
		complex c(Lerp(-1.f, 1.f, kFragCoord.x / 1600.f), kFragCoord.y / 900.f);
		complex z(0.f, 0.f);
		While(z.Conjugate() < 4.f && i < max)
		{
			z = z * z + c;
			++i;
		});
		f32 scale = i / max;
		OutputColor = float4(scale, scale, scale, 0.f);
	};
};
```

## Benefits

* Modern C++ features like templating & auto type deduction, Polymorphism
* Software design patterns, modularity and reusability
* Adapting cutting edge GPU features using extension
* C++ Profiling and Debugging Tools
* Quite fast for compiling many shader permutations (Makes it possible to compile during runtime for small shaders)
* Interchangeable Shading Libraries (Hot-swapping shader DLLs during rendering)
* Write meta programs / code generators
* Vulkan interoperability: create PSOs from SPIRVModules

## Restrictions

Please don't use this for production, the codebase is largely untested and not guaranteed to work. See it as a Proof-of-Concept.

* Variable types are rather long outside the SPIRVProgram context
* Ugly macros for If, While, For etcâ€¦
* Mixing regular C++ variables and var_t<> has undesired sideeffects
* C++ variables are interpreted as constants 
* Vector components can not be extracted by reference
* Recursion is not supported (will blow up instruction recording)
* Return statements will lead to dead code (not translated)
* Missing keywords switch, continue and break
* Ternary conditional operator? can not be overloaded in C++ (Use Select function instead!)

Please read to accompanying paper [Development of a C++/SPIR-V Shader-Runtime](misc/Paper.pdf) and presentation [slides](misc/Slides.pdf) from the Khronos Meetup for more information.

## Build

The SPEAR project currently uses CMake to generate build files. In the root of this project is a `CMakeLists.txt`, which should work for generating Visual Studio solutions. There are some issues when generating Makefiles for GNU Make, but it should in theory work with a bit of fiddling. The requirements are: a `C++17` compliant compiler, a Vulkan SDK and runtime somewhere in your system, which are resolved automatically by CMake. You'll also need `boost` somewhere in your include path, or, alternatively, under `libs/boost` (just the headers, which you can get [here](https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.67.0/source/)). The rest of the dependencies `glm`, `spirv-headers` and `spirv-tools` are fetched automatically by git submodules, and should in theory work out-of-the-box.

**Note:** this is a *very* experimental CMake-file! You might need to hack a bit to make it work on your platform, but it should at least work on a target with Visual Studio & LunarG SDK. Also, it isn't nice enough to provide `find_package` in CMake yet, you'll have to do that sort of stuff manually for now. If you have any improvements, feel free to issue a pull request!

Below is a complete summary of the steps you need to build SPEAR for Visual Studio 2017:

1. Clone this repository down to disk: `git clone https://github.com/rAzoR8/SPEAR`
2. Download `boost` (if it's not in your global include path), and put the headers under `libs/boost`
3. Fetch the rest of the dependencies with: `git submodule init && git submodule update`
4. Generate the Visual Studio solution with `cmake-gui`, modify the *build options* as you see fit.
5. Open the solution in Visual Studio, and set `SPIRVGenTest` as the target project. Build and run.

### Build options

* **SPEAR_ENABLE_PROPERTIES    = ON | OFF (default: ON):** Many convenience facilities are based on __declspec(property), and are not available on e.g. gcc. However, the library can be used without them fine.
* **SPEAR_BUILD_TESTBED        = ON | OFF (default: ON):** Also build the accompanying example project, depending on the libSPEARGen.  This gets you an executable e.g SPEARGenTest that you can (hopefully) run.
* **SPEAR_BUILD_SHADER_FACTORY = ON | OFF (default: ON):** Also build the dynamic shader library project and links it to libSPEARGen, which will be a shared library called libSPEARShaderFactory.so on Unix-es.

### Source code organization

* `SPIRVGen`: Core Spear library
* `SPIRVGenTest`: Simple testbed project
* `SPIRVShaderFactory`: Dynamic shader library example project
* `spirv-tools`: Target output folder for spirv-tool cmake
* `spirv-headers`: SPIRV headers to be used when building
* `boost`: Used for including the boost.DLL library

`SPIRVGen` library project requires Vulkan-SDK files and HLX (submodule) headers.
`SPIRVGenTest` executable project should link `SPIRVGen`.
`SPIRVShaderFactory` shared library project links `SPIRVGen` and requires boost.DLL libraries for the IPlugin DLL interface. Compile with HDYNAMIC_LINKAGE and HDLL_EXPORT defines to create a dynamic shader library.

## Usage

Please look for the example shaders located at SPIRVShaderFactory folder.
