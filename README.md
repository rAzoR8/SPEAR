# SPEAR: C++/SPIR-V Shader Runtime

## Overview

SPEAR is a integrated domain specific language translating C++17 to SPIR-V at host runtime.

```cpp
template <bool Assemble = true>
class Mandelbrot : public FragmentProgram<Assemble>
{
public:
	Mandelbrot() : FragmentProgram<Assemble>("Mandelbrot"){};
	~Mandelbrot() {};

	RenderTarget OutputColor;
	inline void operator()()
	{
		f32 i = 0.f, max = 100.f;
		complex c(Lerp(-1.f, 1.f, kFragCoord.x / 1600.f), kFragCoord.y / 900.f);
		complex z(0.f, 0.f);
		While(z.Conjugate() < 4.f && i < max)
		{
			z = z * z + c;
			++i;
		});
		f32 scale = i / max;
		OutputColor = float4(scale, scale, scale, 0.f);
	};
};
```

## Benefits

* Modern C++ features like templating & auto type deduction, Polymorphism
* Software design patterns, modularity and reusability
* Adapting cutting edge GPU features using extension
* C++ Profiling and Debugging Tools
* Quite fast for compiling many shader permutations (Makes it possible to compile during runtime for small shaders)
* Interchangeable Shading Libraries (Hot-swapping shader DLLs during rendering)
* Write meta programs / code generators
* Vulkan interoperability: create PSOs from SPIRVModules

## Restrictions

Please don't use this for production, the codebase is largely untested and not guaranteed to work. See it as a Proof-of-Concept.

* Variable types are rather long outside the SPIRVProgram context
* Ugly macros for If, While, For etcâ€¦
* Mixing regular C++ variables and var_t<> has undesired sideeffects
* C++ variables are interpreted as constants 
* Vector components can not be extracted by reference
* Recursion is not supported (will blow up instruction recording)
* Return statements will lead to dead code (not translated)
* Missing keywords switch, continue and break
* Ternary conditional operator? can not be overloaded in C++ (Use Select function instead!)

Please read to accompanying paper [Development of a C++/SPIR-V Shader-Runtime](misc/Paper.pdf) and presentation [slides](misc/Slides.pdf) from the Khronos Meetup for more information.

## Build

There is a `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root of this directory, which should work for generating Visual Studio solutions. The requirements are a `C++17` compliant compiler, and that you have a Vulkan SDK setup somewhere in your system, these dependencies are resolved automatically. You will also need `boost` somewhere in your path, but you can download it from [here](https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.67.0/source/) and add it under the `libs/boost` directory in the project root to prevent cluttering your system. The rest of the dependencies: `glm`, `spirv-headers` and `spriv-tools` are fetched automatically by git submodules, and should work out-of-the-box. **Note:** this is a *very* experimental CMake-file! You might need to hack a bit to make it work for your platform! Here is a step-by-step guide on how to build SPEAR:

1. Clone this repository down to disk: `git clone https://github.com/rAzoR8/SPEAR`.
2. Download `boost` (if you don't already have it`) and put it under `libs/boost` in `SPEAR`.
3. Fetch the rest of the dependencies with: `git submodule init && git submodule update --depth 1`.
4. Run `cmake-gui`, and select the SPEAR root directory. Modify the options as you see fit.
5. After generating for your target, open the project and build the different modules.
6. You should now be able to run `SPIRVGenTest`, and link with the libraries too.

## CMake Options

* **SPEAR_ENABLE_PROPERTIES    = ON | OFF (default: OFF):** Many convenience facilities are based on __declspec(property), and are not available on e.g. gcc. However, the library can be used without them fine.
* **SPEAR_BUILD_TESTBED        = ON | OFF (default:  ON):** Also build the accompanying example project, depending on the libSPEARGen.  This gets you an executable e.g SPEARGenTest that you can (hopefully) run.
* **SPEAR_BUILD_SHADER_FACTORY = ON | OFF (default:  ON):** Also build the dynamic shader library project and links it to libSPEARGen, which will be a shared library called libSPEARShaderFactory.so on Unix-es.

### Source code organization

* `SPIRVGen`: Core Spear library
* `SPIRVGenTest`: Simple testbed project
* `SPIRVShaderFactory`: Dynamic shader library example project
* `spirv-tools`: Target output folder for spirv-tool cmake
* `spirv-headers`: SPIRV headers to be used when building
* `boost`: Used for including the boost.DLL library

`SPIRVGen` library project requires Vulkan-SDK files and HLX (submodule) headers.
`SPIRVGenTest` executable project should link `SPIRVGen`.
`SPIRVShaderFactory` shared library project links `SPIRVGen` and requires boost.DLL libraries for the IPlugin DLL interface. Compile with HDYNAMIC_LINKAGE and HDLL_EXPORT defines to create a dynamic shader library.

## Usage

Please look for the example shaders located at SPIRVShaderFactory folder.
