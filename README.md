# SPEAR: C++/SPIR-V Shader Runtime

## Overview

SPEAR is a integrated domain specific language translating C++17 to SPIR-V at host runtime.

## Benefits

* Modern C++ features like templating & auto type deduction, Polymorphism
* Software design patterns, modularity and reusability
* Adapting cutting edge GPU features using extension
* C++ Profiling and Debugging Tools
* Quite fast for compiling many shader permutations (Makes it possible to compile during runtime for small shaders)
* Interchangeable Shading Libraries (Hot-swapping shader DLLs during rendering)
* Write meta programs / code generators
* Vulkan interoperability: create PSOs from SPIRVModules

## Restrictions

Please don't use this for production, the codebase is largely untested and not guaranteed to work. See it as a Proof-of-Concept.

* Variable types are rather long outside the SPIRVProgram context
* Ugly macros for If, While, For etcâ€¦
* Mixing regular C++ variables and var_t<> has undesired sideeffects
* C++ variables are interpreted as constants 
* Vector components can not be extracted by reference
* Recursion is not supported (will blow up instruction recording)
* Return statements will lead to dead code (not translated)
* Missing keywords switch, continue and break
* Ternary conditional operator? can not be overloaded in C++ (Use Select function instead!)

Please read to accompanying paper 'Development of a C++/SPIR-V Shader-Runtime' and presentation slides from the Khronos Meetup for more information.

## Contributing

The SPEAR project is maintained by Fabian Wahlster and hosted at https://github.com/razor8/SPEAR.

## Build

No build files provided at the moment, please consider contributing. A C++17 compliant compiler is required! 

### Source code organization

* `SPIRVGen`: Core Spear library
* `SPIRVGenTest`: Simple testbed project
* `SPIRVShaderFactory`: Dynamic shader library example project
* `spirvtools`: Target output folder for spirv-tool cmake
* `boost`: for boost.DLL

`SPIRVGen` library project requires Vulkan-SDK files and HLX (submodule) headers.
`SPIRVGenTest` executable project should link `SPIRVGen`.
`SPIRVShaderFactory` shared library project links `SPIRVGen` and requires boost.DLL libraries for the IPlugin DLL interface. Compile with HDYNAMIC_LINKAGE and HDLL_EXPORT defines to create a dynamic shader library.

## Usage

Please look at example shaders located at SPIRVShaderFactory folder.
